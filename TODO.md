# TODO: Implement User Agreement Flow

## Plan Summary
Ensure the user sees the agreement first by modifying the ProtectedRoute to check for agreement acceptance and setup completion before showing the main app.

## Steps
1. [x] Update `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` to implement the flow:
   - Check authentication
   - Check if user agreement is accepted
   - Check if setup is completed
   - Render appropriate component based on state
2. [x] Import necessary components (UserAgreement, FirstTimeSetup)
3. [x] Test the application flow
4. [x] Verify localStorage handling

## Current Status
- All steps completed successfully
- Implementation ready for use
